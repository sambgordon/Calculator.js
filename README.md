# Javascript-Calculator
This is a calculator designed in Javascript, as a fork from [thecodeplayer.com](http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/javascript-css3-calculator). 

It supports floating-point numbers and multiple in tandem operations. 

Note: the regex ```
equation ``` is used to replace the ```x``` and ```รท``` with a more conventional ```*``` and ```/```.
