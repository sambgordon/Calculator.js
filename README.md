# Javascript-Calculator
This is a calculator designed in Javascript, as a fork from [thecodeplayer.com](http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/javascript-css3-calculator). 

It supports floating-point numbers and multiple in tandem operations. 

Note: the regex ```javascript
equation = equation.replace(/x/g, '*').replace(/รท/g, '/'); ``` is used
